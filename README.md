Hey this is my portfolio, check it out.


As a self-taught front-end developer, I enjoy learning new skills and problem-solving. I currently develop in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. My goal is to make responsive web apps with clean, readable and easily maintainable code. 

I continue to learn every day and improve my technical capabilities. I'm currently seeking employment as a Jr developer, so I can begin my career as a developer. 

I have always loved programming and throughout my life, I have done it as a hobby. I remember writing/updating scripts for games I was playing or developing web scrapers using Selenium in Python for automating simple tasks I had to do for my job. I also had a passion for programming and now I am looking to take my passion and turn it into a career and I am extremely excited to continue developing into an excellent developer by doing so.
